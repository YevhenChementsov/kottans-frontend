### Summary

*Very interesting information about ***Git*** from the video course.*<br>
*I was familiar with ***Git***, but I repeated some commands, as I did not use
and forgot them.*

*The [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=uk) game is very interesting and educational. Passed 2 times to consolidate
the material.*<br>
*I did not know about rebase, I liked it more than pull (it is more
cleaner), I will definitely use it.*
